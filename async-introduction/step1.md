The [`async`](https://github.com/socketry/async) Ruby gem provides a modern, asynchronous programming framework for Ruby, based on [`nio4r`](https://github.com/socketry/nio4r). It implements the [reactor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern), providing both I/O and timer based events.

Like any other Ruby Gem, we can install it with the `gem` command: `gem install async`{{execute}}
